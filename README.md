# dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles!
First things first, your mileage may vary **greatly**.

## How up-to-date are these things?

Good question.
In the past, this repository has almost never looked like the dotfiles on my
machines.
This has been due in large part to hacks and shims that I added to get
something working on a particular machine which I did not feel deserved to be
committed to the repository.

That said, I am making a concerted effort to synchronize the dotfiles I use on
a daily basis with this repository.
